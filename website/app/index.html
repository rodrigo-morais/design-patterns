            <p class="principal">
                Design patterns are known solutions to recurrent problems in IT world. They are abstract solutions which have to be developed accordiling each problem in each situation.
            </p>

                <h2>Parts of a Design Pattern</h2>
                <h3>Pattern Name</h3>
                <p>
                    The pattern name is how the pattern will be called, and it is used to make easier the comunication among developers.
                    It will describe the pattern in very concise way.
                </p>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    It is the problem which the design patterns have to solve. The problem is common, and occurs over and over again in some environment.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    It is the an abstract solution to the problem, which to describe the actors, relationships, and so on over what is important.
                    Is important to highlight that it is the core of solution, and not the concrete implementation.
                </p>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <p>
                    Describe the pros and cons to use the design pattern, and the cost to use it. The more known cost is the increase of complexity.

                <p>
                    The design patterns are 23 and they are divided in 3 categories: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns

                        <li>Well-Described Solutions: are solutions very well deatailed, and they are used for thousand of other developer proving that they were efficient;</li>
                        <li>Shared Vocabulary and Concise Language: they make easy to communicate with other developers, using a very known and concise vocabulary;</li>
