                <h3>Pattern Name</h3>
                <p>
                    Proxy
                </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Is an interface to a real class. A proxy is a wrapper to a class which will be called by the client, and will be the way to communicate with the software to access its concrete development.

                    It encapsulated the real class to control the access of it.
                </p>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    To use a concrete object which has a high cost to be created.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a proxy which will be a interface for the concrete object, but will create it just when the object has to do some action.
                </p>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep the proxy updated with the concrete class can bring complexity to the software;</li>
                </ul>
