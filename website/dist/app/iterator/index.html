                <h3>Pattern Name</h3>
                <p>
                    Iterator
                </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Define a list the objects which can be accessed sequentially.

                    The list is an aggregate of objects which not exposes the object details, but allows go through the aggregate of object getting each one.
                </p>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The problem is to go through a aggregate of object where each object could have a different type, and allow it be crossed.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a object called Iterator that accepts be iterated and has standard methos to do it.
                </p>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        if the aggregate of objects is changed when it is gone through, the software will receive an exception;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
