                <h3>Pattern Name</h3>
                <p>
                    Observer
                </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Define an one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its  dependents are notified and updated automatically.

                    A more simple way to explain it is to say that Observer pattern is just the Publish / Subscribe relationship, so we have one publisher or subject, and one or more subscribers or observers. Each subscriber has to subscribe to a publisher, and observe it. When a publisher publish something, all observers will receive the message.

                    It is like a Twitter. When you start to follow some one you will become a subscriber, and the followed is the publisher. If this person publish something, you and all other subscribers will receive the publication.
                </p>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The problem is to send a message to an innumerable number of objects. The object which send the message don't know how much objects are, and who they are. Beyond that is necessary doesn't have a relationship among publisher and subscribers, the coupling has to be weak.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The solution is to create a publisher which sends a message to a collections of subscribers which subscribed to receive it. The publisher don't knows who are the subscribers, and the subscribers can unsubscribe to receive the message in any moment.
                </p>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        publisher can never send a message, and the subscribers can wait for that in vain;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        publisher can send the same message repeatedly, and subscriber has to deal for that;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        publisher can send messages very quickly, and subscriber has to be prepared to that;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        publisher can have a strong coupling with subscribers because of the subscription process, and it can avoid the Garbage Collection remove old objects from memory;
                    </li>
                </ul>
